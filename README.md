# Text-Summarization
Document and text summarization is the process of condensing a text document into a shorter version while retaining its key information and main ideas. It is the process of simplifying relevant information from large documentations and literature, without losing the crucial information of the original text. In this project, several methodologies of patent document summarization is explored, comparing and contrasting various ways of summarizing text. The methodologies covered in this report are:

A.Extractive summarization
B.Abstractive summarization
C.BERT model  (Bi-directional Encoder representation from Transformers)
D.T5 (Text to Text transfer transformer)
E.Pegasus model. 

Steps Involved in Text Summarization

1. Text cleaning
2. Sentence tokenization
3. Word tokenization
3. Word-frequency table
4. Summarization
5. ROUGE Metrics evaluation

   SCOPE OF EVALUATION

-  Aim: To generate insightful summary from domain specific patent data documents while retaining all necessary Information.

-  Input data formats: .pdf, .doc, raw text
Capturing context from text is not implemented in this project

File Name	Description
BERT_model.py	Generating summary using BERT model
Pegasus.py	Generating summary using Pegasus model
T5_model.py	Generating summary using T5 model
Reference_Summary.py	For generating a reference summary for ROUGE evaluation
Pdf_text.txt	The input pdf is converted into text and saved in this .txt file
generated_summary.txt	Summary generated by respective models stored in this .txt file
Reference_summary.txt	Reference summary stored in this .txt file


-  Content Category: Patent Data

-  Evaluation Metrics: ROUGE Scores
rouge 1, rouge 2, rouge N and rougeL

-  Summarization Criteria: The system will be evaluated based on its ability to capture key information, maintain coherence, and provide a concise and informative summary.
